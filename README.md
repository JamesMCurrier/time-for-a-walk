# time-for-a-walk
### A random time generator in **EVERY** programming language

## But, why??
A few co-workers and myself went for walks around our building every afternoon.

We didn't want our walks to be at the same time everyday, because that's boring.

One morning, to plan our daily walk in advance, I made a quick Python program to generate a random time between 1 and 4 pm.

I sent an email invite for the walk, and attached a copy of my code.

In response I received a random walk generator in JavaScript and another in R.

The next day I sent another invite, this time with Java. The trend continued.

From that day on, every morning I sent an invite for a walk at a random time, generated with a new language.

Then a month passed...
